**role** — Defines whether the user is a guest or host

#### **2. Properties**

Represents the accommodations listed by hosts on the platform.

**Fields:**

**id** — Primary key, unique identifier for each property

**title** — Name or short description of the property

**description** — Detailed information about the property

**price_per_night** — Cost of staying per night

**host_id** — Foreign key linking to the Users table (host)

#### **3. Bookings**

**user_id** — Foreign key referencing the guest (from Users)

**property_id** — Foreign key referencing the booked property

**check_in_date** — Start date of the booking

**check_out_date** — End date of the booking

#### **4. Reviews**

Stores user feedback and ratings for properties after their stay.

**Fields:**

**id** — Primary key, unique identifier for each review

**user_id** — Foreign key referencing the reviewer (from Users)

**property_id** — Foreign key referencing the reviewed property

**rating** — Numeric value (e.g., 1–5)

**comment** — Text feedback about the stay

#### **5. Payments**

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

A User (host) can list multiple Properties.

A User (guest) can make multiple Bookings.

A Booking belongs to one Property and one User (guest).

A Property can have many Reviews, and each Review is written by one User.

Each Booking can have one Payment record, ensuring transaction traceability.

**Entity Relationship Summary:**

User (Host) 1 --- N Property

User (Guest) 1 --- N Booking

Property 1 --- N Booking

Property 1 --- N Review

Booking 1 --- 1 Payment

### 💡 **Example Use Case**

A guest (User) books a property (Property) listed by a host (User).
After completing the stay, the guest can leave a review (Review), and the system records a payment (Payment) for the booking.

## ⚙️ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project replicates the essential functionalities of a real-world accommodation booking platform. Each feature is designed to enhance user experience, ensure data consistency, and support a smooth end-to-end booking process.

🧑‍💻 1. **User Management**

This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It supports two primary roles — hosts (who list properties) and guests (who make bookings). Secure authentication and role-based access control ensure data privacy and proper user permissions.

🏠 2. **Property Management**

Hosts can list, update, or delete their properties, including uploading images, setting prices, and adding descriptions. This feature ensures that each property listing is detailed and easily searchable, helping guests find suitable accommodations quickly.

📅 3. **Booking System**

Guests can search for available properties, view details, and make bookings for specific dates. The system prevents double bookings and maintains accurate check-in/check-out records, ensuring a smooth reservation experience for all users.

💳 4. **Payment Integration**

The project includes a secure payment processing system that allows guests to pay for bookings through various methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal). Payment status tracking ensures that both guests and hosts have transparent and reliable transaction records.

⭐ 5. **Review and Rating System**

After a completed stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This feedback system promotes trust and transparency, helping future guests make informed decisions and encouraging hosts to maintain high-quality listings.

🔍 6. **Search and Filtering**

Users can filter properties based on location, price range, amenities, or ratings. This feature improves navigation and helps users find accommodations that best match their preferences and budgets.

🛡️ 7. **Security and Authentication**

Implements user authentication, password hashing, and input validation to protect user data. Security protocols ensure that all user interactions and transactions occur in a safe environment.

🚀 8. **CI/CD and Deployment Pipeline**

The project uses GitHub Actions and Docker to automate testing, integration, and deployment. This ensures that new updates are delivered efficiently while maintaining system stability across environments.

## 🔒 API Security

Security is a core component of the Airbnb Clone Project, ensuring that all user data, transactions, and communications remain confidential and tamper-proof. The project applies multiple layers of security across authentication, authorization, and data protection to safeguard both hosts and guests.

### 🧩 Key Security Measures
1. Authentication

Implements secure user login and identity verification using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.
Why it matters:
Prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only verified users can perform actions such as booking properties, adding listings, or leaving reviews.

2. Authorization

Controls user permissions based on roles (e.g., host, guest, admin).
Why it matters:
Ensures that users can only access resources or perform actions relevant to their roles — for example, guests can book properties but cannot modify property listings owned by other users.

3. Input Validation and Sanitization

Validates and sanitizes all user inputs before processing.
Why it matters:
Protects the system from common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and data corruption caused by malicious input.

4. Data Encryption

All sensitive data (like passwords and payment information) is encrypted using industry-standard hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, SHA-256).
Why it matters:
Keeps user credentials and financial details secure, even in the event of a database breach.

5. Rate Limiting

Restricts the number of API requests a client can make in a given time frame.
Why it matters:
Prevents abuse of the system (e.g., brute-force login attempts, denial-of-service attacks) and ensures stable performance for all users.

6. HTTPS and Secure Communication

All client-server communications occur over HTTPS, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.
Why it matters:
Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception during communication between users and the server.

7. Error Handling and Logging

Implements safe error responses and activity logging for debugging and security monitoring.
Why it matters:
Ensures sensitive information is not exposed in API error messages and helps detect suspicious activity in real time.

### 🛡️ Importance of Security Across the Project

**User Data Protection:** Safeguards personal information such as emails, passwords, and contact details.

**Secure Payments:** Prevents fraudulent transactions and ensures trust between guests and hosts.

**System Integrity:** Protects the platform from malicious users and preserves the reliability of all services.

**Compliance:** Aligns with best practices for privacy, authentication, and data security standards.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### ⚙️ What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production environments. It ensures that new features and bug fixes are delivered quickly, consistently, and with minimal errors.

#### - Continuous Integration (CI):
Automatically tests and merges new code into the main branch to detect and fix issues early.

#### - Continuous Deployment (CD):
Automates the delivery of tested code to production or staging environments, ensuring fast and reliable updates.

### 🚀 Importance for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline in the Airbnb Clone Project helps maintain code quality, streamline collaboration, and reduce deployment risks.
It enables:

Faster development cycles through automation of builds, tests, and deployments.

Early bug detection, preventing integration issues.

Consistent environments, reducing “it works on my machine” problems.

Improved collaboration, as all team members push and test code under the same automated process.

### 🧰 Tools and Technologies Used

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
|----------|-------------|
| **GitHub Actions**	| Automates CI/CD workflows, such as testing and deploying code on every push or pull request. |
| **Docker**	| Provides consistent containerized environments for development, testing, and deployment. |
| **MySQL**	| Ensures a reliable and standardized database configuration across environments. |
| **Django**	| Works seamlessly within the CI/CD process for backend builds and testing. |

### 🧩 Example Workflow

A developer pushes new code to GitHub.

GitHub Actions automatically runs tests and checks code quality.

If tests pass, the code is built into a Docker container.

The container is deployed to a staging or production environment.

This automated flow ensures that every update is stable, secure, and production-ready.
